	* The Arduino, is the brain - this is a micro controller
	* A cable to attach it to the PC 
	* AA batteries & a battery holder

Now attach:

	* the wheels to the servos
	* the battery pack to the breadboard
	* attach the servo wires to the breadboard, make sure the red and black wires are attached correctly on the breadboard.

Now:

	* add the batteries to the battery pack
	* move the battery pack and the breadboard onto the chassis. Stick them using double sided tape and tick-tack.

Attach:
	
	* the white servo wires to the Arduino, to pins 12 & 13
	* the ground wires from the Servos to ground on the Arduino.

Attach you Nodebot to the laptop and take it for a spin.

To run it use this command : ```node battlebot.js```
	
Now add scoop to ready for battle:

	* First attach the scoop holder using one cable ties
	* Attach it on the opposite end of the omni wheel
	* Then add the scoop itself with 2 bigger cables ties, be sure not to attach the scoop to high.

It should look like this remember:
